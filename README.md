Split the bill is a web app that can help managing expenses after a night out easier. Simply type in the names of the people involved and upload a picture of the receitp. The backend is equiped with an OCR that parses out all of the itmes and the prices of the items.

With this, it prompts the user to choose who bought which item. After this, it displays each person's portion of the bill and even includes tax and tips in the calcualtions!
